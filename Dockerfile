# Note: --ignore-scripts skips postinstall hooks (including electron-builder install-app-deps)
# This is intentional to avoid issues in the container. The electron-builder install-app-deps
# is explicitly run in the 'builder' stage before packaging to ensure native dependencies
# are correctly installed for the Linux target platform.
